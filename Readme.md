📘 Project Overview

This project is made for the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course. It allows users to manage a mobile phone inventory using simple C++ code with classes, inheritance, file handling, and exception handling.


---

✨ Key Features

✅ Add records of Simple Mobiles and Smartphones

♻ Update mobile price by model

❌ Delete a mobile from the list

🔍 Search for a mobile by model

📁 Read/Write data from a file

⚠ Handles invalid input using custom exception

🧠 Uses OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual functions



---

👥 Multi-user System

Designed to work smoothly for multiple users

Ensures data safety and supports hierarchical data management



---

🧪 OOP Concepts Used

Classes and Objects

Inheritance (SimpleMobile and SmartPhone from base class Mobile)

Polymorphism (Virtual functions used for display and file operations)

Exception Handling (Handles negative price with InvalidPriceException)

File Handling (Save and load mobile records from mobiles.txt)



---

🛠 How to Use

1. Open the project in your C++ IDE (Turbo C++, Dev C++, or Code::Blocks)


2. Compile and run the program.


3. Use the menu to:

Add / Update / Delete / Search mobile records

Save or load records using file

📌 Future Improvements

Add login system for different user roles (admin/user)

Improve exception handling and input validation

Use vector or file-based database for better performance
